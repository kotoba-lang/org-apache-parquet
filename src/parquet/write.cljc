(ns parquet.write
  "Parquet files, written from `columnar.vector` columns.

  ## Why this exists when `arrow.write` already did

  Arrow IPC records no column statistics, so an object materialised as Arrow
  **cannot be pruned** — every later query over it reads every batch. Chain a
  few materialisations and the intermediates are strictly weaker than the
  Parquet they came from.

  Parquet is the format that fixes that, and it fixes it in the container
  every other tool already reads rather than in a sidecar this workspace would
  have to invent and keep from drifting. **The writer computes min/max/null
  counts as it goes** — it has the columns in hand — and writes them into the
  footer, where `parquet.source` finds them without reading a page.

  There is a test asserting exactly that: a query over a file written here
  reads one row group and skips two.

  ## What it writes

  One row group per batch, one PLAIN-encoded, uncompressed data page per
  column chunk. `int32`, `int64`, `double`, `byte_array` — **exactly the set
  `parquet.decode` can read back**, because writing what our own reader
  refuses would be a strange thing to own. Everything else is refused by name.

  ## Definition levels

  A REQUIRED column writes no levels section at all. An OPTIONAL one writes a
  4-byte little-endian length, then RLE runs of the levels, then the values
  **for the present rows only** — which is why the levels have to be written
  before the count of values is known."
