  "A Parquet file as a `columnar/IColumnSource`.

  The split `columnar.source` insists on — cheap statistics, expensive reads
  — is not an accommodation here; it is what a Parquet file already is. A row
  group's min/max live in the footer, so `-chunk-stats` costs nothing beyond
  the metadata already parsed, while `-read-column` has to reach the pages.

  **`-chunk-stats` works on files `-read-column` refuses.** Encoding and
  compression are properties of the pages; statistics are not. So a snappy
  dictionary-encoded file — which this reader cannot decode — still prunes,
  still answers `count`, still answers `min`/`max`. There is a fixture for
  exactly that, because it is the difference between a reader that is
  partially useful and one that is useless until complete."
