(ns parquet.footer
  "The Parquet footer: schema, row groups, and the statistics pruning runs on.

  A Parquet file ends `… <FileMetaData> <4-byte footer length LE> PAR1`, so
  the metadata is found by reading the last 8 bytes and then seeking
  backwards. Two range reads locate everything about a file of any size —
  which is the entire reason in-place query is affordable.

  **The footer does not depend on how the pages were encoded.** Statistics
  are readable from a file compressed with a codec this repo cannot
  decompress and encoded with an encoding it cannot decode. That is not a
  curiosity: it means chunk pruning, `count`, `min` and `max` work on files
  `read-column` refuses. `parquet.source` leans on it, and there is a fixture
  written with snappy + dictionary specifically to hold that line."

  A bound this runtime cannot represent exactly is **dropped, not raised**.
  The two cases differ in whether a safe degradation exists: an absent bound
  means `columnar.stats` will not prune, which is slower and still correct,
  while an unrepresentable VALUE has no safe answer and `parquet.decode`
  refuses it. Raising here instead would make one oversized column render the
  whole file unopenable on ClojureScript — including for the columns that are
  perfectly fine. Measured: a single int64 past 2^53 did exactly that."
