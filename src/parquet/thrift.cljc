  "Thrift compact protocol decoder — the format Parquet's metadata is written in.

  Parquet's footer is a Thrift `FileMetaData` struct in the *compact*
  protocol, so nothing about a Parquet file is readable until this is. It is
  its own namespace because it has nothing to do with columns: it is a
  self-contained byte grammar, and keeping it separate is what lets it be
  tested against byte sequences taken from the protocol spec rather than
  against this repo's idea of a Parquet file.

  Reads from a vector of unsigned ints. That is a portable representation
  rather than a fast one — a typed array would avoid the boxing — and the
  choice is stated here because the profile that reveals it would otherwise
  arrive as a surprise. Every reader threads an explicit position, so the
  decoder is pure."

(defn le-uint
  "Unsigned little-endian integer of `n` bytes, EXACTLY or not at all.

  The obvious spelling — `(+ acc (* byte (Math/pow 2 (* 8 k))))` — is wrong
  for int64. 2^56 times a byte exceeds 2^53, so the top two bytes of a 64-bit
  value land beyond double precision and the answer comes back quietly
  rounded. It is quiet on the JVM too, because `Math/pow` returns a double
  and the sum is a double before anything casts it back.

  So: exact integer arithmetic on the JVM, and on ClojureScript — where
  numbers ARE doubles — a value past `MAX_SAFE_INTEGER` is refused rather
  than rounded. A reader that returns a plausible wrong number is worse than
  one that says it cannot represent this value, because nothing downstream
  can tell."

;;
;; Two things the compact protocol does that a naive encoder gets wrong:
;;
;; - **A field id is stored as a DELTA from the previous field**, in the high
;;   nibble, and only when that delta is 1..15. Fields must therefore be
;;   emitted in ascending id order, and a larger gap falls back to a zigzag
;;   varint. Emitting them out of order produces a struct that decodes to
;;   different field ids without failing.
;; - **A boolean has no value bytes.** Its value lives in the field header's
;;   type nibble (1 for true, 2 for false), so a bool written as "type 3 plus
;;   a byte" desynchronises everything after it.

  decides it fits in one byte, and emits it as one. The result decodes to

  path shifts with `unsigned-bit-shift-right` and tests the high bits directly.
