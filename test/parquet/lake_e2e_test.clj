  "The whole chain, over a real Parquet file: catalog → authorization →
  triple pattern → column chunk.

  Every layer has its own tests against its own fakes, and each of those is
  worth having — but a fake column source cannot show that a triple pattern
  survives four translations and arrives as a byte range, and a fake catalog
  cannot show that the authorization gate stands between a query and a file
  that really exists. This is the one test where nothing is stubbed except the
  transport, and the transport is stubbed only to count what it moved.

  A `.clj` rather than a `.cljc`: it is JVM-only on purpose (the fixture is
  read with `clojure.java.io`, and the point here is the composition rather
  than a platform conditional — each library carries its own cross-runtime
  suite). Saying so in the extension rather than the docstring is what keeps
  clj-kondo from linting it as portable code and reporting `with-open` as an
  unresolved symbol."
