  "The writer, checked against this repo's reader and the engine.

  **This suite cannot establish that the output is valid Parquet**, and the
  history of this file is the proof. Two measured failures, both invisible
  from inside the repo:

  1. The first version round-tripped through `parquet.source` perfectly while
     pyarrow refused to open it at all — `ColumnChunk.file_offset` is
     `required` in the thrift IDL and our reader never looks at it.
  2. The second opened cleanly with **every statistic invisible** to pyarrow —
     without `column_orders` the spec forbids trusting `min_value`/`max_value`,
     so a file whose statistics only this repo could see would have failed at
     the one job the writer was given.

  So the correctness gate is `test/fixtures/verify_written.py`. What this
  suite is for: values, nulls, chunking, refusals, and the property the writer
  exists for — that a file written here **prunes**."
