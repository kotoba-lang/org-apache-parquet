  "Writes Parquet files for `test/fixtures/verify_written.py` to check.

  The in-repo suite cannot make this claim, and two measured failures say why:
  the first version of the writer round-tripped through `parquet.source`
  perfectly while pyarrow refused to open it (`ColumnChunk.file_offset` is
  `required` and our reader never reads it), and the second opened cleanly
  with **every statistic invisible** to pyarrow (no `column_orders`, so the
  spec forbids trusting `min_value`/`max_value`).

  The statistics case is the one that matters most: Parquet was chosen over a
  sidecar precisely BECAUSE other tools read its statistics, so a file whose
  statistics only this repo can see would have failed at the one job it was
  given — while every test in this repo passed."
