"""Regenerate the test fixtures using the REFERENCE implementation.

Python, and not nbb, for one reason: the only trustworthy oracle for a
Parquet decoder is a file written by Parquet's own writer, and that writer is
reachable from this machine through pyarrow. A fixture this repo generated
itself would test the decoder against its own misunderstanding.
